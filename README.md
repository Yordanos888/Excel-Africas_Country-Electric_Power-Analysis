# Africa’s Country Electricity & Renewable Energy Analysis

This project presents an Excel-based analysis of **electricity access** and **renewable energy generation** across African countries.  
The goal is to explore key energy trends, identify gaps, and provide insights relevant to policy, development, and sustainability.

---

## 🔍 Overview  
The analysis covers multiple dimensions of Africa’s energy landscape, including electricity access, renewable energy (RE) share, and regional performance.  
A variety of analytical questions are answered using Excel tools, custom visuals, and cleaned datasets.

## 📘 Key Research Questions

### **1. Descriptive / Summary Questions**
- Which African countries have the highest and lowest electricity access rates?
- Which countries show the fastest growth in renewable energy since 2000?
- What is the distribution of renewable sources (solar vs hydro vs wind) by region?

### **2. Analytical / Comparative Questions**
- Is there a relationship between renewable capacity and electricity access?
- Does income-group classification influence energy access?
- How do regions in Africa compare in terms of electricity access?

### **3. Trend / Time-Series Questions**
- How has electricity access evolved in Africa since 2000?
- Which countries made the largest improvements in renewable energy between 2010–2023?

### **4. Policy / Real-World Insights**
- Which African countries appear to be on track to meet **UN SDG 7.1: universal access to electricity by 2030**?
- Which countries show a discrepancy—high renewable potential but low electricity access?

## ⚠️ Challenges & Data Limitations

- **Inconsistent year coverage**:  
  Not all datasets include 2025, and electricity access data does not include 2024.  
  → As a result, all analysis stops before the current year.

- **Single-year RE statistics**:  
  The dataset *“RE-Stat (2024)”* contains only one year of data, which limits long-term renewable energy trend analysis.

---

## 🧠 Final Insights

- **North African countries** generally show **high electricity access**, but they remain **highly dependent on non-renewable energy sources**.
- **Sub-Saharan African countries** tend to have **strong renewable energy shares**, yet **low electricity access**, creating a large energy gap.
- Due to these disparities, only a **few countries** appear close to achieving **UN SDG 7** targets.
